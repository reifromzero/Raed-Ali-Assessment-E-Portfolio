			Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)
		</h2>
		<p>
			The World Wide Web (web) is a system/network of sites and online information which can be searched and retrieved by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or the secure variant, HTTPS. The computers connected to the web are clients and web servers. The client is the computer which sends out the HTTP/HTTPS request through a web browser and the web server is the computer which retrieves and sends back the requested information. This allows users to search and retrieve from the world wide web for documents, videos, sounds and information through links/URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). Web browsers have a role in the web as they are used to send requests through links under the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. The link/URL must be exact in order to reach the desired location. The request sent by the client's web browser then contacts the web server as a HTTP/HTTPS link that acts as a command that directs it to fetch the requested webpage for it to then be sent  back, received and interpreted by the web browser. The web server is the underlying computer software and hardware in the World Wide Web that accepts HTTPS/HTTP requests and sends back HTTP/HTTPS responses.

		<h2>
			How is the World Wide Web Different to the Internet?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The World Wide Web and the internet may seem very similar or the same as they have the role in connecting online information from a network. However, the way they function is quite different. The internet is a network of networks connected through computers and cables. The internet's role is to send 'packets' of information from one computer to another. The Internet exists physically as a network or networks, while the web is an abtractly existing space where there is a collection of information and content from computers. The web exists as a service using the internet as an infrastructure to use programs in computers to communicate between information each other. Thus, the web could not exist without the internet as it is an expansion of the internet where it operates on. The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, used the internet as a global network or as pathways to connect World Wide Web for applications on computers to communicate information and webpages in HTML and now CSS and JavaScript using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that are under the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What is an Intranet? 
		</h2>
		<p>
			An intranet is a private network or group of networks that are permanently connected and use the protocols of the internet and the World Wide Web. This may seem similar to a Local Area network but is different in standards because it uses the protocols at the standard of the internet and World Wide Web such as TCP/IP, UDP and HTTP. Users connected to an intranet may have access to web browsing and searching the internet, but this is usually in a controlled manner, where an intranet can be restricted/protected from open access to the wider internet. Thus, the main difference between the internet and an intranet is that an intranet is a privately managed division of networks, while the internet is a publicly accessible worldwide network.
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of an intranet is a school-wide network. Computers have access to the internet but the internet but through a proxy server. The proxy server can be used to prevent access to certain parts of the internet or webpages. Since internet standards are used in this intranet, computers or devices of any kind can have access to common files and servers.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What is an Internet Protocol?
		</h2>
		<p>
			An internet protocol is a method or agreed standard through which data is sent from one client to another on the internet. This set of rules is for the addressing and the routing of data packets. Each computer has at least one IP (Internet Protocol) address that makes it unique from the rest fo the computers. Computers and networks don't only follow a single internet protocol as there are multiple protocols working together to allow computers to communicate, each specialising in their own ways. 
		</p>
		<p>
			TCP/IP, a communication protocol, is considered the most basic protocol, being a single protocol but in fact consisting of 2 protocols. IP (Internet Protocol) is the most basic protocol which defines the address of a computer on the internet, where every computer is issued an IP address, a string of 4 numbers separated by full stops. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the second part, which defines and controls how 2 computers on the internet exchange data. TCP is at work when your computer attempts to contact or reach a server and receives data.
		</p>
		<p>
			HTTP, a transfer protocol, is the underlying internet protocol used in the World Wide Web. This protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands from the client computer. When a URL is entered into a web browser, a HTTP command is sent to the web server, directing it to fetch the requested web page.
		</p>
		<p>
			FTP, another transfer protocol, is an internet protocol which allows for the uploading and downloading of files to and from other computers on the internet. For example, When you are downloading a program installer from the internet or attaching a file in an E-Mail, the FTP protocol is at work.
